# KernelBench Agent Framework

Our KernelBench agent framework builds off of KernelBench. We chose to fork the original KernelBench repository, consolidating the agent framework implementation with the benchmark set that our framework is designed for. The agent framework could, in principle, be decoupled to operate on a more general set of tasks, but this is not currently our primary goal. Thus, we chose simplicity over modularity, ensuring that the agent framework is well-tuned to the benchmark we are optimizing for.
